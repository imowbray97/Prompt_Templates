### ðŸ§  Example in Action (Math Word Problem)

> **Task:** If a train leaves New York at 2 PM traveling 60 mph and another leaves Boston at 3 PM traveling 80 mph toward New York, at what time will they meet if the distance between the cities is 300 miles?
>
> **Let's think step by step.**
>
> **Step 1:** Identify the core goal â€“ when the two trains meet.
>
> **Step 2:** Train A travels 1 hour earlier at 60 mph â†’ it covers 60 miles before Train B starts.
>
> **Step 3:** Remaining distance = 300 - 60 = 240 miles.
>
> **Step 4:** Trains now approach each other at a combined rate of 60 + 80 = 140 mph.
>
> **Step 5:** Time to meet = 240 Ã· 140 = 1.714 hours â‰ˆ 1 hour 43 minutes.
>
> **Final Answer:** They meet at approximately 4:43 PM.
